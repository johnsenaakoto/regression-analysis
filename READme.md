In this notebook, I will generate regression models that can be used to predict the progression of diabetes based on 11 features.

The diabetes data set described in lecture can be obtained as a single file, diabetes-data.csv, from the course website. We obtained it at https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/LARS/diabetes.data. For some background information on the data, see this seminal paper:

Bradley Efron, Trevor Hastie, Iain Johnstone and Robert Tibshirani (2004) "Least Angle Regression," Annals of Statistics (with discussion), 407-499.
